# 🛒 Retail Sales Forecasting System

## 📘 Project Overview
**Retail Sales Forecasting System** is a Machine Learning project designed to predict product sales across multiple retail outlets using historical sales data. The dataset contains detailed information about products, stores, and their performance.  

The main goal is to build a robust **regression model** that can accurately forecast future sales and help businesses make data-driven decisions on inventory management, pricing, and product placement.  

This project covers the complete data science lifecycle:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
- Feature engineering  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Generating predictions and saving results  
- Saving the trained model for future use
